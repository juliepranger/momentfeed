Hey there! This is a little Angular application I made to allow people a chance to get to know me via my Instagram feed.
Due to the recent updates to the Instagram API (since I played with it last), this will be a Sandbox-mode app, and as such, is far more limited in scope than if this was a production-ready and approved by Instagram.

This project assumes you have npm and gulp ready to go on your local machine.
To make sure you have all necessary dependencies, please run the following command:

```
npm install
```

To run this project locally, please run the following commands in your project root:

```
gulp
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 3000
```

You can then hit the following URL in your browser:
```
http://0.0.0.0:3000/
```
